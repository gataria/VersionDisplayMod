# VersionDisplayMod
## Summary
A Minecraft 1.8.9 mod that shows the current version number on the top left corner of the player's in-game screen, intended to replicate the appearance of older beta and alpha Minecraft versions.
## Notes
- Minecraft 1.8.9 is a very old version of the game, and so is its Forge mod development kit (MDK 11.15.1.2318). This version has long been deprecated, so support might be hard to come by.
- This code cannot be used directly on modern Minecraft/Forge versions, due to changes performed by both parties in the last 7 years since 1.8.9's release date.
- In writing this mod, I had to use a very old version of Gradle (2.14.1) and an old version of IntelliJ IDEA (2016.1.4) due to the resulting compatibility issues.
## Credits
- I have to thank wehavecookies, [whose 1.11 modding tutorial on GUI overlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsZaYaQA8X4) and [written code](https://github.com/Wehavecookies56/Tutorial-Mod) was instrumental in giving me a base to work off.
  - Modding is hard, and programming GUI overlays is not a well-documented subject, unfortunately!
- I also have to thank Jayden, my friend for whom this mod was written. Happy birthday!
